# Crimson | Animation Logger & Spy

An animation logging/spying tool made by vez. Effortlessly log animations and their properties, find a use for them!

---

## Script

Execute this script in your executor:

```lua
-------------// SETTINGS \\-------------
getgenv().SafeMode = true
-- Anti-Detection kick (if applicable)
getgenv().AutoClearLogsDelay = 99999
-- How many seconds to wait before logs are automatically cleared
getgenv().BlockedAnimations = {"Animation1", "Animation2", "RunAnim", "WalkAnim"}
-- Animations to block from logging

getgenv().ChosenTargetFolder = nil
--[[
    In ChosenTargetFolder, change nil to destination folder
    to start logging the animations of all models with a
    humanoid within that folder when using 'Log: Others' option
    Otherwise it will not allow you to select 'Log: Others'
]]--

local ScriptDev = "Vez"
local ScriptName = "Crimson"

loadstring(game:HttpGet(("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/%sise/2026/main/%s/%s.lua"):format(ScriptDev, ScriptDev, ScriptName)))("Animation Spy")
```

## Key Features

- **Instantaneous Logging** - Instantly log animations
- **Animation Blocking** - Block specific animations that may be useless or annoying (by name via the config, AnimId support not added yet)
- **Choose Your Targets** - Log animations from your LocalPlayer, all Players or from a path of your own
- **Auto Clear Logs** - Automatically clear logs on a customizable interval
- **'As Simple As Possible'** - Extremely simple to use, even for people who lack knowledge in Luau

## Why Would I Use This?

- **Game Development** - Steal animations for your own use
- **Exploit Research** - Discover exploits (Invisibility, Auto Parry, etc.) using this tool
- **Script Logging** - Some obfuscated scripts use animations for exploits, such as mentioned above; use this tool to figure what animations & properties they are using 
- **Animation Replication** - Animations played on your client replicate to the server.. show off?
- **Do It Yourself (DIY)** - Figure out why you want to use this!

## Configuration

### Auto Clear Logs Delay
Controls how often (in seconds) logged animations are automatically deleted to clear clutter and save some performance.

```lua
getgenv().AutoClearLogsDelay = 99999
```

### Animation Blacklist
Specify the names of animations you want to exclude from logging to avoid clutter of useless animations like 'Idle' or 'WalkAnim'

```lua
getgenv().BlockedAnimations = {"Animation1", "Animation2", "RunAnim", "WalkAnim"}
```

### Target Folder For Specific Logging
Set a specific path (paired with 'Others' target option) to log animations from all the Humanoid/AnimationController within it. Leave it as `nil` if you won't be using this feature.

```lua
getgenv().ChosenTargetFolder = nil
```

> **Tip:** You can use Dex Explorer scripts such as [BypassedDarkDexV3](https://github.com/Babyhamsta/RBLX_Scripts/blob/main/Universal/BypassedDarkDexV3.lua) to find the path for logging descendants with Humanoid/AnimationController (could for example be a specific NPC or folder of NPC's).

## Animation Preview
**Loop Preview, Delay Loop** - Previews the selected animation on a viewmodel with a delay option to give it a little timeout before playing again
<img width="126" height="187" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f696b9f0-d5c7-478e-a4f5-c950b5d7938d" />


## Delay Settings
**0s / 1s / 2s / 3s** - Delay the logging of animations, I don't know why you'd want this.. but I made it a feature anyways.

## Logging Targets
Select what animations to log:
- **LocalPlayer** - Log only your own animations
- **All Players** - Log animations from all players except yourself
- **Other** - Log animations from a custom path (model, folder, etc.) you specify

## Copy AnimId
Copy the AnimationId of the selected animation to your clipboard.

## Copy Properties
Generates a script with all the animations' properties so you can run it yourself or implement it into your script.

## Play Anim
Replicates the selected animation on to your character (replicated to the server, meaning anyone can see).

## Property Display
When an animation is selected, the UI displays the properties of the animation to provide you with more information, these same properties get copied when using 'Copy Properties'.

## Logging Toggle
Toggle logging on & off, self explanatory.

## Stacking Toggle
Stacks animations with the same AnimationId to avoid clutter; recommended to use this for performance and for your own sanity.
